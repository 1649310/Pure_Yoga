              pain can help many people who suffer from tension. It is very

              Yoga socks are a great accessory for every yogi. If you ever
              practiced in regular socks, you know it can get quite slippy and
              even dangerous – especially when you’re doing Hot yoga or vigorous
              Vinyasa flows. Practicing barefoot, on the other hand, can be
              unsafe and unhygienic in crowded yoga studios. That’s why yoga
              grip socks are getting increasingly popular among both newbies and
              experienced yogis alike. They prevent slipping, protect your feet
              from fungus in public spaces, and help you focus.
